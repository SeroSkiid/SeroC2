## 🖥️ Remote Desktop

### Usage
1. Right-click a client → **Remote Desktop**
2. Adjust **Quality** (1–100) and **Resolution** (%) sliders
3. Click **Start** — live feed appears in the viewer
4. Interact directly: click, type, scroll, clipboard sync
5. Click **Stop** to end the session

### How it works

**Primary — DXGI Desktop Duplication** (`IDXGIOutput1::DuplicateOutput`):
- GPU-direct capture via the DWM compositor — no CPU copies
- Blocks on `AcquireNextFrame(timeout=16ms)` aligned to VBLANK — natural 60 fps pacing

**Fallback — GDI BitBlt** (`GetDC` + `BitBlt`):
- Works on RDP sessions, headless machines, non-BGRA GPU formats
- Multi-monitor aware via `EnumDisplayMonitors`

**Delta compression — 64×64 block diff:**
- Only changed blocks are encoded and transmitted
- Below 15% change → quality boosted to 95 for sharp text
- Above threshold → full frame sent instead

**Input injection** via `SendInput`: mouse + keyboard (virtual key codes + extended key flag)

---

## 📷 Remote Webcam

### Usage
1. Right-click a client → **Remote Webcam**
2. Select a device from the dropdown
3. Adjust **Quality** and **FPS** → click **Start**

### How it works

**Primary — DirectShow** (COM, pure P/Invoke):
- Device enumeration: `ICreateDevEnum` + `CLSID_VideoInputDeviceCat`
- Capture graph: `ICaptureGraphBuilder2` + `ISampleGrabber` targeting RGB24 or YUY2
- JPEG encode: raw pixels → GDI+ `GdipSaveImageToStream`

**Fallback — VFW** (`avicap32.dll`):
- `capCreateCaptureWindow` + `WM_CAP_*` messages
- `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` frame callback — no delegate allocation per frame

---

## 👁️ HVNC

Hidden Virtual Desktop — creates an isolated Windows session invisible to the user.

### Usage
1. Right-click a client → **HVNC**
2. Use the browser launcher buttons (Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Opera, Opera GX, Telegram, Discord) for instant stealth sessions
3. Full mouse + keyboard input injection on the hidden desktop

---

## 📁 File Manager

Full remote file system browser with icon-per-extension UI.

### Features
- **Navigate** — browse drives, directories, double-click to enter
- **GoTo** shortcuts — Desktop, User Folder, Temp, AppData, Startup
- **Download / Upload** — single file up/down
- **Execute** — Normal, Hidden, or As Admin
- **Rename / Delete / New Folder**
- **SHA-256 Hash** — computed on client, copied to clipboard
- **Show / Hide** — toggle hidden file attribute
- **Set as Wallpaper** — set any image as desktop background
- **Play Music** — open audio file with default player
- **7-Zip compress** — zip via PowerShell Compress-Archive
- **Download from URL** — pull file from internet directly to client

---

## 🔌 TCP Manager
Lists all active TCP connections (PID, process name, local/remote address, state). Force-close connections via `SetTcpEntry(DELETE_TCB)`. **Block IP** and **Block Port** toolbar buttons create Windows Firewall rules (inbound + outbound) for the selected connection.

## 🚀 Startup Manager
Enumerates and deletes startup entries from:
- Registry `HKCU\Run` / `HKLM\Run` / `RunOnce`
- User and Common Startup folders (`.lnk`)
- Scheduled Tasks (via `schtasks /query`)
- WMI Event Subscriptions (`__EventFilter`, `CommandLineEventConsumer`, `__FilterToConsumerBinding`)

Each entry shows an **Authenticode verification status** (Verified / Not Verified) with publisher name, checked via `WinVerifyTrust`. Unverified entries are highlighted in red (like Autoruns).

## 🎙️ Microphone
Real-time audio capture using WaveIn (WinMM):
- Device enumeration and selection
- Live waveform visualization (bar graph, 50 ms refresh)
- Buffered PCM stream (16-bit, 16 kHz, mono)
- **Save as WAV** — proper WAV header written to disk

## 🎮 Fun
Interactive prank / control panel:

| Section | Actions |
|---------|---------|
| CD-ROM | Eject / Close |
| Taskbar | Show / Hide |
| Explorer | Kill / Start |
| Screen | On / Off |
| Clock / Tray | Show / Hide |
| Desktop Icons | Show / Hide |
| Mouse | Normal / Swap buttons |
| Volume | +5 / −5 / Mute |
| Screen Rotation | 0° / 90° / 180° / 270° |
| Crazy Mouse | Random mouse for N seconds |
| Text to Speech | Speak any text via `System.Speech` |
| Message Box | Show popup dialog on victim screen |
| Open URL | Open any URL in default browser |

---

---

## ⌨️ Keylogger

Low-level global keyboard hook using `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` — invisible to the user, captures all keystrokes system-wide.

### Features
- **Window-title headers** — each context switch is logged with the app name and UTC timestamp
- **Auto-sync** — server pulls buffered logs every 10 seconds while capturing
- **Manual get / clear** — request logs on demand or wipe the buffer on client
- **Save as TXT** — export the full log from the server UI

### How it works
The stub installs a low-level keyboard hook via `SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL)`. The hook callback (`[UnmanagedCallersOnly]`, NativeAOT-safe) converts VK codes to characters using `ToUnicode` with the current keyboard layout (handles international keyboards, Shift, CapsLock). The log is buffered in memory and capped at 512 KB; the server drains and displays it in a scrollable monospace text area.

---

## ₿ Crypto Clipper

Silently monitors the clipboard and replaces detected crypto addresses with your own.

### Supported coins
BTC · ETH/BNB · LTC · TRX · SOL · XMR · XRP · DASH · BCH

### Features
- **Per-coin addresses** — configure a replacement address for each currency independently
- **Detection log** — every replacement is logged to the server UI with timestamp, coin type, and truncated original address
- **Live counter** — total replacements shown in the server window
- **Enable / disable** — toggle without reconnecting; state persists until changed

### How it works
The stub polls the clipboard every ~450 ms using native Win32 `OpenClipboard` / `GetClipboardData` / `SetClipboardData` (no Windows Forms dependency, fully NativeAOT-compatible). Detected addresses are matched against regex patterns and replaced atomically. A real-time notification is sent to the server via `ClipperDetected` packet so the operator sees every swap instantly.

---

---

## ⚙️ Process Manager

Live view of all running processes on the target with native Windows shell icons.

### Features
- **Process list** — name, PID, working-set memory, main window title
- **Native icons** — shell icon extracted from the process EXE via `SHGetFileInfo`
- **Search** — filter by name or window title in real time
- **Suspend / Resume / Kill** — right-click context menu
- **Refresh** — manual refresh button

---

## 🪄 RunPE / Process Hollowing

Full in-memory PE injection pipeline, NativeAOT-compatible.

**Pipeline:**
1. `CreateProcess(..., CREATE_SUSPENDED | DETACHED_PROCESS)` against a configurable host (`svchost.exe`, `dllhost.exe`, …)
2. **PPID Spoofing** — `UpdateProcThreadAttribute(PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS)`: injected process appears as child of `explorer.exe` (user) or `winlogon.exe` (admin)
3. `NtUnmapViewOfSection` → `VirtualAllocEx` + `WriteProcessMemory` + base relocations
4. IAT fixup — walks the import directory, resolves each DLL/function via `GetProcAddress`
5. `SetThreadContext` sets `RCX = EntryPoint + ImageBase` → `ResumeThread`

> **Credit** — RunPE originally authored by **Hydra48** ([process-hollowing-24h2](https://github.com/hydra48/process-hollowing-24h2)), converted to C#/NativeAOT by SeroSkiid.

## 🔌 AutoTask Plugins (C++ DLL)

Native DLL plugins compiled on-demand and delivered in-process. Only disk artifact is the temp DLL, deleted after execution. Cached by source hash.

| Plugin | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Exclude C:\\** | Adds `C:\` to Defender exclusions via WMI `MSFT_MpPreference` (SYSTEM token steal) |
| **Block AV DNS** | Redirects ~80 AV update/telemetry domains to `127.0.0.1` in hosts file. Blocks DoT (port 853). Flushes DNS. |
| **Block Reset** | Patches `ReAgent.xml` to disable WRE. Blocks Etcher/Rufus/USB tools. |
| **BotKiller** | Kills processes from `%TEMP%`, masquerade detections, unsigned random-name executables. Cleans startup. |
| **Disable UAC** | Sets `EnableLUA=0`, `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin=0`, `ConsentPromptBehaviorUser=0`, `PromptOnSecureDesktop=0` via PowerShell (requires admin; takes effect on next logon). |

---

## 🔒 Persistence

The stub copies itself to `%AppData%\Roaming\<PersistName>\<HiddenFileName>`.

| Method | Visibility | Implementation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Registry `HKCU\Run` | Visible | `NtSetValueKey` (bypasses behavioral hook) |
| Startup Folder `.lnk` | Visible | Native binary Shell Link writer (no COM) |
| Scheduled Task | Hidden from Startup tab | `schtasks /Create` + `ONLOGON /IT` — admin required; client relaunches as SYSTEM on logon |
| WMI Subscription | Invisible to Startup tools | `__EventFilter` + `CommandLineEventConsumer` in `root\subscription` — fires once per boot (within the first ~10 min); admin required only for initial install, runs as SYSTEM automatically on reboot |
| Registry `HKLM\Run` | Admin only | `NtSetValueKey` |

**Watchdog:** file lock on installed exe + backup, `FileSystemWatcher` instant restore, 5-second polling fallback, isolated PPID-spoofed persistence worker (breaks Defender Persistence.A!ml correlation).

---

## 💀 Anti-Kill

- **DACL** — `ACE DENY PROCESS_TERMINATE + PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME` for `Everyone` — blocks Task Manager and all tools without `SeDebugPrivilege`
- **4 guardian processes** in `dllhost.exe` / `SearchProtocolHost.exe` / `SearchFilterHost.exe` with PPID spoofing, staggered 800ms apart

---

## 🔐 Crypter

> **The crypter / loader / UAC bypass is closed-source and NOT included in this repository.**

The builder generates a **polymorphic native C++ loader** that encrypts and launches the stub in memory.

**UAC Bypass:** SilentCleanup windir-hijack → scheduled task → CMSTP INF → EventVwr → WsReset → Sdclt → ComputerDefaults → Fodhelper — non-registry methods tried first  
**SYSTEM Elevation:** SeDebugPrivilege → `winlogon.exe` token duplication → `CreateProcessWithTokenW`

**Encryption pipeline:**
1. **LZNT1** compression via `ntdll!RtlCompressBuffer`
2. **AES-256-CBC** with random per-build key/IV embedded as RCDATA resource
3. **SFC64 stream cipher** — resource payload encoding (1:1 ratio, 32-byte random seed per build)

**Polymorphism:** per-build random AES key split across 3 binary locations, random 8-byte magic signature, unique BuildId GUID, random junk function names and shuffled call order.

**AMSI + ETW Bypass:** ETW patched first (`EtwEventWrite`) then AMSI (`AmsiScanBuffer`) via `NtWriteVirtualMemory`; 4-byte `push 0; pop eax; ret` patch, XOR-obfuscated per build.

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Analysis Suite

| Protection | Technique |
|-----------|-----------|
| Anti-Debug | `IsDebuggerPresent`, `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent`, `NtQueryInformationProcess`, `NtSetInformationThread(ThreadHideFromDebugger)`, timing check |
| Anti-VM | BIOS registry keywords (VMware/VirtualBox), VMware Tools key, VirtualBox Guest Additions key |
| Anti-Detect | Process blacklist (x64dbg, IDA, Wireshark, ProcessHacker, Process Explorer, dnSpy, ILSpy…), suspicious usernames |
| Anti-Sandbox | Scoring: uptime < 3min, sleep-skip detection, temp files < 3, RAM < 1 GB, installed programs < 8, generic VM artifacts (Manufacturer/Model/BIOS GUIDs) |
| CIS Country Block | **Separate checkbox** — block CIS countries (RU/BY/KZ/AM/AZ/KG/TJ/TM/UZ/MD) via `BlockCis` toggle |

---

## 🌐 Network Architecture

- **TLS 1.2+** with SHA-256 certificate pinning
- **Shared-key authentication** verified on every connection
- **3-second heartbeat** + RTT measurement (ping/pong)
- **Auto-reconnect** with configurable delay (default 5s), multi-host round-robin

**Packet format:** 4-byte little-endian length prefix + UTF-8 JSON body. Max 100 MB per packet, 60-second read timeout.

---

## ⛏️ XMR Miner

Standalone Monero mining module, fully separate from the main RAT stub.

**Features:**
- Embeds xmrig at build time — SFC64 stream cipher + Deflate compression (random seed per build)
- **Native TLS** — scans xmrig in memory for the OpenSSL marker at runtime; if found, passes `--tls` directly on the command line (no proxy, no config file); falls back to a loopback TLS-terminating proxy for builds without OpenSSL
- **CLI-arg launch** — all pool parameters (`-o`, `-u`, `-p`, `-a`, `--tls`, `--randomx-no-rdmsr`) are passed on the command line; no `config.json` dependency for the pool connection
- **Process hollowing** — xmrig runs inside a legitimate `svchost.exe` via NtCreateSection/NtMapViewOfSection; no xmrig file touches disk during mining
- **PPID spoofing** — hollowed process appears as a child of `explorer.exe`
- **Idle throttle** — full CPU when idle, drops to active limit when user is at the machine
- **Stealth** — kills hollowed xmrig if Process Explorer / Task Manager / Process Hacker is detected; restarts cleanly when they close
- **Watchdog** — in-process file integrity watchdog (FileSystemWatcher + polling), backup copy, named-event clean exit; persistence restore only runs when `EnableStartup=true`
- **SafeBoot persistence** — optional service registered in SafeBoot registry keys
- **Stats server** — optional lightweight HTTP dashboard (token-protected)
- **BotKiller** — kills competing miners on startup and every 30 s

**Setup:** place `xmrig.exe` (with OpenSSL) in `xmrig-release/` before building.

## 🛠️ How to Compile

**Prerequisites:**
- .NET 10 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++** workload
- Windows SDK 10.0.22621+
- **DevExpress 25.2** WPF components — **required** for compilation. The project uses `dx:ThemedWindow`, `dx:DXImage`, and the DevExpress theme engine throughout. Install from [devexpress.com](https://www.devexpress.com/). The project references DLLs at `C:\Program Files\DevExpress 25.2\Components\Bin\NetCore\`. Without DevExpress installed the project will not compile.

### Step 1 — Install prerequisites

```bat
setup.bat
```

Run as Administrator — installs everything via winget (.NET SDK, VS Build Tools 2022 with MSVC + Windows SDK).

### Step 2 — Build server

```bat
build.bat
```

Produces `dist\SeroServer.exe` (self-contained, no .NET runtime required on target).

Or open `Sero.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 and press `F6`.

### Step 3 — Build the client stub

1. Launch `SeroServer.exe`
2. Go to the **Builder** tab
3. Configure hosts, auth key, persistence, hollow target
4. Click **Build** — the stub is compiled with NativeAOT and optionally crypted

### Step 4 — Build the XMR miner (optional)

1. Place `xmrig.exe` (with OpenSSL support) in `xmrig-release/`
2. In the server, go to **Builder → XMR** tab
3. Fill wallet, pool, CPU limits
4. Click **Build Miner**

**Optional — UPX compression (8 MB → 2.4 MB):**

Download [upx.exe](https://github.com/upx/upx/releases) (Windows x64) and place it either:
- in your `PATH`, **or**
- in a `tools/` folder next to `SeroServer.exe`

Then tick **UPX compression** in the Builder before clicking Build. The `tools/` folder is gitignored — the binary stays local.

**Troubleshooting:**
- `cl.exe` (MSVC) missing → run `setup.bat`
- `vswhere.exe` not found → add `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer` to PATH
- NativeAOT requires `win-x64` RID — do not mix in wasm workloads
- UPX not found → see above
